### **Date-Tagging System & Visual Calendar Project (LIS 640 | 2025–2026)**

This repository contains all documentation, datasets, reports, and deliverables for the collaborative semester-long project with the **UW–Madison Transportation Services Department**.  
Our goal is to build a **centralized, easy-to-maintain date-tag dataset** and a **visual drag-and-drop calendar interface** that improves the department’s ability to identify comparable historical days for forecasting, planning, and operational decisions.

## 🧭 Project Overview

Transportation Services currently tracks external factors—academic schedules, events, closures, weather, and transit changes—in **separate systems**.  
This makes it difficult to quickly identify past days with similar conditions.

Our project aims to:

- Integrate all relevant factors into a **unified tagged master dataset**  
- Design a **visual calendar interface** with drag-and-drop tagging  
- Provide **MySQL + Tableau integration guidance**  
- Develop documentation for long-term maintenance  
- Deliver clean datasets, job aids, a technical manual, and a final report

This repository serves as a **single access point** for the partner organization and our instructional team.
